You are tired after trying to look for another job, so you took a ride on a PUV somewhere in Downtown Tacloban.
As the vehicle reached Samar, something strange happened.
And then you woke up in a weird place.
### It is time for you to seek answers.



# Lagusan Sa Biringan
> The planned story revolves on the mysterious hidden city known as Biringan (which is an Eastern Visayan folklore in the Philippines), but with some modern twists.

> Conceptually, i took inspiration from Chernobylite, Last Day of Earth, Zero Sievert, and Metro Exodus. The story is a mess, and it was what I saw from my dreams (may sound silly, but take it as you will)

> The demo is still lacking because of constraints, but I'll continue working on it post-jam anyway; but I'll pack what i can pack more before the deadline.

> Graphics may differ, depending on your emulator. Screenshots were taken from Lemuroid.
> In the web version of itch, it uses the web emulator of GB Studio.
